# MortgageApp
The objective of this project is to build an Android app to help users determine their ability to afford buying a house. If the house price is $700,000 for example, then this amount is known as the principle. If you don't have this amount, you would need to approach a bank to get a mortgage. If approved, the bank will purchase the house for you and you would need to pay the bank back through a sequence of monthly payments whose value is determined based on three things: the principle, the annual interest rate (e.g. 4.5%), and the amortization peiod (the number of years you have to keep making monthly payments). The amortization in Canada is typically between 20 and 30 years.
